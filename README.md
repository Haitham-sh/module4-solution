## Description

It is an assignment in the course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" by Johns Hopkins University in partnership with Coursera.

**Summary**: In this assignment, I am going to loop over an array of names and print out either a `hello` or `goodbye` to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with the letter `j` or `J`, will print out `Goodbye JSomeName`. If the name starts with any other letter, will print out `Hello SomeName`. What fun! (not!:wink:)
